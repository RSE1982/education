# 📊 Education Inspection Trends & School Performance Analysis (England)

## 📖 Project Overview

This project analyses school inspection outcomes in England alongside attainment, school characteristics, and demographic context to explore factors influencing educational quality.

The aim is to demonstrate:

- Data cleaning and integration of public datasets
- Exploratory and statistical analysis
- Potential predictive modelling
- Clear communication of insights for non-technical audiences.

This project uses official UK public-sector datasets released under the Open Government Licence v3.0.

## 🎯 Objectives

Key research questions include:

- How have inspection ratings changed over time?
- Are inspection outcomes associated with attainment metrics?
- Do regional or socioeconomic factors influence outcomes?
- Can inspection ratings be predicted from performance indicators?

## 📊 Data Sources

### Primary dataset

- Ofsted school inspection outcomes (Jan 2026 snapshot + five-year data)

### Supporting datasets

- Department for Education performance tables (KS2–KS5)
- School metadata (establishment information)
- Census/demographic indicators.

### Licence:

Contains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v3.0.

## 🧹 Data Processing Workflow

### 1. Data Understanding

- Dataset structure review
- Missing value assessment
- Variable standardisation.

### 2. Data Cleaning

- Date formatting
- Category normalisation
- Identifier alignment (URN matching).

### 3. Data Integration

- Merging inspection, attainment, and demographic datasets
- Feature engineering for analysis.

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis

Typical analyses:

- Inspection rating distributions
- Regional comparisons
- Attainment vs inspection correlations
- Time-series inspection trends.

Visualisations generated using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib/Plotly).

## 🤖 Modelling

- Classification models predicting inspection outcomes
- Clustering schools by performance indicators
- Feature importance analysis.

Ethical considerations and interpretability are emphasised.
